The Standalone OBC project can out of a need to find fresh batteries for a 2002 Toyota RAV4EV
The Nissan Leaf battery pack seemed like the obvious donor pack
The Leaf charger with the Chademo and J1772 capability seemed liek teh simle solution to provide charging in a tide package.
Eh it was more complectated than expected.
