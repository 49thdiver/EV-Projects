The Standalone OBC project came out of a need to find fresh batteries for a 2002 Toyota RAV4EV
The Nissan Leaf battery pack seemed like the obvious donor pack
The Leaf charger with the Chademo and J1772 capability seemed like the simple solution to provide charging in a total package.
Eh it was more complictated than expected.
