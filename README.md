# EV-Projects
DISCLAIMER : This is a work in progress, this repository of information is what documentation I have pulled togeather from my work to get this out into the pubic domain. I have little enough time to develop the projects let alone make videos and documentation, this is it, no appologies. Put it to good use, tell folks where you go it from send me money of you are making money. Be safe, have fun.

Nissan Leaf based EV conversions
After a few years of working on EV conversions from scratch the search for readily available and affordalbe batteries led to the Nissan Leaf.
The Leaf is an excellent donor platform for everything EV
The projects here have come from this work.
The most obvious and first project here is the Stand Alone Charger project.
The Nissan Leaf charger is essentially a controlable contstant current power supply.
The sucessful project out come is here.
Enjoy
