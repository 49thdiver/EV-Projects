This is likely the most ambitious project here.
A 1984 Grumman Olsen Kubvan turned 2015 Nissan Leaf.
The whole meal deal, subframe and drive train, battery and interior electronics, brake system power steering the works. Stay tuned. Van is on the road but needs completing and documenting.

Stay tuned.
